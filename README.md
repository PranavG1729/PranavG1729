Hi! Pranav here.
I'm interested in programming at the moment. Eventually looking to delve into algorithms involving Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I'm familiar with Python and C. Hoping to learn Java this year because of APCSA. Later on, I'm thinking of learning a few low-level languages, just because it can give me more control over the computer.
I'm not on any social media (bloody hate it). If we're IRL friends I can probably add you on WhatsApp, but for now you're best off contacting me at my email: goyalp7326@gmail.com
